# 01: The "SHALL" is part of a quoted passage from the Bulk Data Access FHIR IG which explains the various parameters. The Helios document does not add any additional conformance requirements.
INFORMATION: en/technical.html: The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: '_type            Server Usage: Optional       Client Usage: Optional       Description: A string of comma-delimited FHIR resource types. The response SHALL be filtered to only include resources of the specified resource types(s).        ' 

# 02: The differences are that the main Jira Spec Artifact contains a version 1.0.0 which is the original PDF publication version. This is not in the IG publisher jira-new.xml
WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG.  A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.  To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)
